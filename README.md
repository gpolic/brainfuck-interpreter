#What is Brainfuck ?
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.
The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer.
The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual
that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.

The Brainfuck Programming Language
http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/

This is a Brainfuck interpreter written in Java, and implements some basic optimizations. 
The implementation is using 60K memory cells of 8bit
The primary focus is to simplify the main interpreter loop for efficient execution.

#Performance
On Intel i7 4790 Desktop PC, Windows 7, Oracle JDK 64bit
mandelbrot.b completes in 8.8 sec
hanoi.b code will complete in 1.0 sec
long.b code will complete in 6.0 sec

On Intel Pentium T3400 Laptop (Dual core 2.16Ghz), Windows 7, Oracle JDK 64bit
mandelbrot.b will complete in 24.0 sec
hanoi.b completes in 4.5 sec
long.b code will complete in 16.5 sec

#Usage:
Feed the code in a String into BrainInt.newProgram(String)
The interpreter object returned can call executeBf() to run the program:

Example:

	String brainFuckCode = ">++++[>++++++<-]>-[[<+++++>>+<-]>-]<<[<]>>>>--.<<<-.>>>-.<.<.>---.<<+++.>>>++.<<---.[>]<<.";

	BrainInt brainInterpreter = BrainInt.newProgram(brainFuckCode);
	try {
		brainInterpreter.executeBf();
	} catch (Exception e) { ... }

Optimizations here are heavily influenced on Daniel Cristofani's "quick and dirty interpreter"
